In finite element models (FEMs), two- or three-dimensional Representative Volume Elements (RVEs) based on a statistical distribution of particles in a matrix can predict mechanical material properties. This article studies an alternative to 3D RVEs with a 2.5D RVE approach defined by a one-plane layer of 3D elements to model the material behavior. This 2.5D RVE relies on springs applied in the out-of-plane direction to constrain the two lateral deformations to be compatible, with the goal of achieving the isotropy of the studied material. The method is experimentally validated by the prediction of the tensile stress–strain curve of a bi-phasic microstructure of the AlSi10Mg alloy. Produced by additive manufacturing, the sample material becomes isotropic after friction stir processing post treatment. If a classical plane strain 2D RVE simulation is clearly too stiff compared to the experiment, the predictions of the stress–strain curves based on 2.5D RVE, 2D RVE with no transversal constraint (called 2D free RVE), and 3D RVE simulations are close to the experiments. The local stress fields within a 2.5D RVE present an interesting similarity with 3D RVE local fields, but differences with the 2D free RVE local results. Since a 2.5D RVE simplifies one spatial dimension, the simulations with this model are faster than the 3D RVE (factor 2580 in CPU or taking into account an optimal parallel computation, a factor 417 in real time). Such a discrepancy can affect the FEM2 multi-scale simulations or the time required to train a neural network, enhancing the interest in a 2.5D RVE model.
