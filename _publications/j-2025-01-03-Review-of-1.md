Inconel 718 (IN718) is a polycrystalline nickel-based superalloy and one of the most widely used materials in the aerospace industry owing to its excellent mechanical performances at high temperatures, including creep resistance. Interest in additively manufactured components in aerospace is greatly increasing due to their ability to reduce material consumption, to manufacture complex parts, and to produce out-of-equilibrium microstructures, which can be beneficial for mechanical behavior. IN718’s properties are, however, very sensitive to microstructural features, which strongly depend on the manufacturing process and subsequent heat treatments. Additive manufacturing and, more specifically, Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) induces very high thermal gradients and anisotropic features due to its inherently directional nature, which largely defines the microstructure of the alloy. Hence, defining appropriate manufacturing parameters and heat treatments is critical to obtain appropriate mechanical behavior. This review aims to present the main microstructural features of IN718 produced by LPBF, the creep mechanisms taking place, the optimal microstructure for creep strength, and the most efficient heat treatments to yield such an optimized microstructure.
