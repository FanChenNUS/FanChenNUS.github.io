4D printing technologies are currently suffering from the inability to produce rapid motions, which limit their applications that require fast shape transformation such as rapid unlocking and deployment of aerospace equipment. Herein, inspired by the shooting mechanisms of Viola verecunda fruit for seed dispersal, the 4D-printed biomimetic catapult is developed. Based on the structure change characteristics of gradient fan-shaped cells of the fruit pods during seed ejection, the biomimetic smart catapult is processed via the programming of spatial distribution of heterogeneous materials with various storage modulus enabled by additive manufacturing. This catapult can achieve high-speed ejection with the logically stimuli of external force, temperature, light, humidity, or electricity. The proposed biomimetic 4D printing strategy has broken through the limitations in motion speed, which helps fully unleash the potential of 4D printing.
