At high temperature, metallic material creep is difficult to avoid. The understanding of the creep mechanisms helps metallurgists to design optimal alloy compositions and the prediction of a component life is a key input to manage safe maintenance and to define operational cost of any production line (solar plant parts, heat exchanger, any turbine parts loaded at high temperatureâ€¦).
