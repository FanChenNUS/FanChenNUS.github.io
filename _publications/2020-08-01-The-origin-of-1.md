The origin of dense dislocations in many additively manufactured metals remains a mystery. We here employed pure Cu as a prototype and fabricated the very challenging high-purity (>99.9%) bulk Cu by laser powder-bed-fusion (L-PBF) technique. We found that high-density dislocations were present in the as-built samples and these high-density dislocations were introduced on the fly during the L-PBF process. A newly developed multi-physics modeling was further employed to interpret the origin of these pre-existing dislocations, demonstrating that the compression-tension cycles rendered by the localized heating/cooling heterogeneity upon laser scanning are responsible for the residual high-density dislocations.
