Dr. Fan Chen is a computational mechanics and advanced manufacturing researcher with cross-disciplinary expertise in additive manufacturing, AI-integrated modeling, and high-performance simulation. Currently a Research Scientist at the University of Liège funded by the European Union, he leads work on AI-powered characterization and modeling for green steel technology in collaboration with Fraunhofer, IWM, and IMDEA. His recent work involves implementing visco-plasticity laws in Lagamine and developing creep models for metallic systems.

His technical strengths include advanced numerical simulation (ABAQUS, COMSOL, FLOW-3D), programming (Fortran, Python, MATLAB), and multi-scale modeling for process–structure–property relationships in manufacturing. He also has experience teaching mechanics and materials science at NUS and mentoring students on computational mechanics.
