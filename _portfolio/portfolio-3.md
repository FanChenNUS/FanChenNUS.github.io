High-fidelity coupled CFD-FEM simulation on DED and LPBF
---
 -- corporation with ANSYS

Linked the high-fidelity molten pool dynamics model with the finite element solver for thermal stress simulation.

High-density dislocations in additively manufactured metals
---
 -- corporation with Shanghai Jiaotong University

Demonstrated that thermal stresses are the origin of high-density dislocations in additively manufactured metals using the coupled CFD-FEM simulation. 

Physically informed data-driven prognostic model for the temperature prediction in AM
---
 -- corporation with Singapore A*STAR

High accuracy and significantly faster computation speed for the track-scale AM modeling based on the data-driven prediction (CNN, GPR, QR) of the isotherms and the isotherm-reconstructed temperature attribution on FEM model. 

Pattern-oriented Strain Attribution in Part-scale Modeling of Additive Manufacturing
--- 
 -- corporation with Singapore A*STAR

Efficient large-scale AM modeling approaches with sound physical basis, where the layer-wise element progressive activation is applied with base strain pattern attributed onto the sample layers.
